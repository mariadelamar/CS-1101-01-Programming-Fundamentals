# My CS 1101 Programming Fundamentals Assignments
Welcome to my repository! This collection of assignments is part of my CS 1101 Programming Fundamentals course as I work toward my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Throughout this course, I've been diving into the world of Python, building my programming skills, and applying what I've learned to real-world problems.

Each assignment in this repo represents a step in my learning journey, where I’ve explored concepts such as basic algorithms, functions, and problem-solving. I’m excited to continue growing my skills, and I look forward to using these foundations to tackle more advanced topics in the future.

Feel free to explore the code, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
