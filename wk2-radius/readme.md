##Assignment: Circle Circumference Calculation
This code was written for CS 1101-01 Programming Fundamentals, week 2, as part of my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. The task was to implement a function print_circum that calculates the circumference of a circle using the formula:

Circumference=2πr

Where r is the radius of the circle. The function takes the radius as input and prints the result rounded to five decimal places.

I tested the function with three different radius values to verify its correctness.
